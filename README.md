# Back-end studies 

The backend (or “server side”) is the portion of the website you don’t see. It’s responsible for storing and organizing data, and ensuring everything on the client-side actually works. </br>

Among other things, the backend takes care of data processing, storage, and security. </br>

The backend communicates with the frontend, sending and receiving information to be displayed as a web page. </br>

Whenever you fill out a contact form, type in a web address, or make a purchase (any user interaction on the client-side), your browser sends a request to the server side, which returns information in the form of frontend code that the browser can interpret and display.

### Database

A database is an organized collection of data stored in a computer system and usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). The data in common databases is modeled in tables, making querying and processing efficient. Structured query language (SQL) is commonly used for data querying and writing.

```Types of database```

* **Relational Databases**: A relational database’s contents are arranged as a collection of tables with rows and columns. Accessing structured data is made most flexible and efficient by relational database technology.

* **Object-Oriented Databases**: Similar to object-oriented programming, data in an object-oriented database is represented as objects.

* **Distributed Databases**: A distributed database is made up of two or more files that are spread across multiple locations. The database could be dispersed across many networks, housed in one physical place, or kept on several computers.**
