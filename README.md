# Back-end studies 

The backend (or “server side”) is the portion of the website you don’t see. It’s responsible for storing and organizing data, and ensuring everything on the client-side actually works. </br>

Among other things, the backend takes care of data processing, storage, and security. </br>

The backend communicates with the frontend, sending and receiving information to be displayed as a web page. </br>

Whenever you fill out a contact form, type in a web address, or make a purchase (any user interaction on the client-side), your browser sends a request to the server side, which returns information in the form of frontend code that the browser can interpret and display.

### API 

API stands for Application Programming Interface. In the context of APIs, the word Application refers to any software with a distinct function. Interface can be thought of as a contract of service between two applications. This contract defines how the two communicate with each other using requests and responses. Their API documentation contains information on how developers are to structure those requests and responses.
